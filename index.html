            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Amsterdam, under the supervision of Arthur Schram and Randolph Sloof.</p>
            <p>My research examines voting behaviour, with a focus on protest voting. I investigate the interaction between protest voting and opinion polls. I also explore whether this behaviour does affect politicians' behaviour.</p>
            <p>In my job market paper, I explore the consequences of voting decisions on prosocial attitudes and examine whether the preferences or votes of others are more important determinants of how altruistic voters behave towards each other. A current draft of that paper is available here.</p>
            <p>Before my academic journey, I worked for the British Civil Service in both analysis and policy roles.</p>
