            <p>Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Amsterdam, under the supervision of Arthur Schram and Randolph Sloof.</p>
            <p>My research focuses on voting behaviour. More specifically, I am to understand the relationship between public information and the propensity to engage in protest voting (voting against your true preferences to send a signal of discontent), whilst also studying the conditions under which this behaviour leads to desirable outcomes for those that engage in it. I also examine politicians' behaviour to explore whether protest voting is an effective strategy. </p>
            <p>In my job market paper, I explore the consequences of voting decisions on prosocial attitudes and examine whether the preferences or votes of others are more important determinants of how altruistic voters behave towards each other. A current draft of that paper is available here.</p>
            <p>Before my academic journey, I worked for the British Civil Service in both analysis and policy roles.</p>
